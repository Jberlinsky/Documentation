# Sifchain Node Operators

If you are interested in staking your ROWAN tokens to earn rewards, but don’t want to be bothered with the technical requirements & maintenance to do so, then consider delegating your tokens to one of Sifchain’s existing Validators. Read more about delegation [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/delegators).

In order to help you make an informed decision regarding which validator to delegate to, we have compiled the below data from a Validator Survey.

_All information in this table is composed of direct responses from Validators themselves. We have not verified any of this data. Please do your own research and feel free to reach out to any Validator through their displayed social media handle._  


| Validator Address | Discord Handle | Other blockchains I run Nodes for |  Experience with Cosmos-SDK/Tendermint based blockchains | How long do you plan on running the node? | Why would you stop running your node? | What kind of emergency response plans do you have? |

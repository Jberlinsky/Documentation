# BetaNet Launch

## BetaNet Definition

Welcome to the Sifchain DEX BetaNet! We are very excited about this launch and for your participation in it. We encourage you to use all of the features the platform has to offer, and to provide any and all feedback you have within our \#support channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/a2UHqapD9x). Please be aware that this is a BetaNet launch and we expect to improve and iterate as we receive feedback. 

### Security Measures <a id="3857"></a>

\(To input\)

### Front End <a id="3857"></a>

We have created our Sifchain DEX UI \(insert link\) to be **an extremely user-friendly interface** for people to interact with while engaging in the Sifchain network. Users will be able to easily execute token swaps, add to liquidity pools, and use [Peggy](https://blog.cosmos.network/sifchain-announces-peggy-cosmos-ethereum-cross-chain-bridge-eeb46a8f91db) through this interface. Users will be able to utilize wallets such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and [Keplr](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/dashboard) for Sifchain. Our goal is to make everything easy and interoperable.

### Peggy <a id="aad4"></a>

We have enabled users to **transfer assets between Ethereum and Sifchain** through a non-[IBC \(Inter-Blockchain Communication\)](https://cosmos.network/ibc) permissioned version of Peggy. Users will be able to freely utilize those assets in the Sifchain network while performing swaps and adding to liquidity pools. If users are finished utilizing these assets, they are free to use Peggy to move them back into Ethereum.

### SifNode <a id="75f2"></a>

We have enabled users to stake a node as a [validator](https://medium.com/sifchain-finance/validator-in-a-box-plug-and-play-passive-income-generator-47f4d26e428e), **earning rewards and charging fees** for securing the Sifchain network. If a user lacks the technical resources or knowledge to stake a node, they can simply delegate to existing validators to earn rewards.

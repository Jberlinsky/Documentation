# Liquidity Pooling Dynamic FAQs

## Is there risk of stake slashing? if yes, where can we read more on this?

There is always some risk as is with everything in the crypto industry. Though more information can be found [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/validators).

## What are the un-bonding periods for nodes / for delegations?

Our un-bonding period is around set to around 21 days to avoid malpractice, from the date of un-bond issued. More information can be found [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/validators). 

## Are any rewards earned time-locked?

Yes, they are, more information can be found [here](https://medium.com/sifchain-finance/uses-for-rowan-the-polyvalent-token-for-omni-chain-decentralized-exchange-dex-3207e7f70f02) 

## What are the approximate costs of setting up a Validator?

$100-$200/month, 5-10 man hours per month, some technical staff to handle it, but it works out profitable in the long run. We further recommend getting them to set it up for you, but to move ownership in your own hands so as to have maximum visibility on your capital.

## How are validators paid?

The validators are paid out based on validator income as per [this article](https://medium.com/sifchain-finance/validator-in-a-box-plug-and-play-passive-income-generator-47f4d26e428e) with further parameters as our [liquidity mining program](https://medium.com/sifchain-finance/uses-for-rowan-the-polyvalent-token-for-omni-chain-decentralized-exchange-dex-3207e7f70f02) for validators.

## What is the benefit of using kuberentes over non-kubernetes infrastructure, if any?

Kubernetes is best for cluster management. It's possible to just do makeshift cluster management on your own although Kubernetes is now a standard for cluster orchestration among devops engineers.

## For storage, running a validator which kind of node type should I run? \(Archival node \| Fully pruning node \| Default pruning node\)

At Sifchain we believe that the Archival is most complete, but feel free to make a different choice based on any different parameters.

## Will node operators be able to stake their unvested tokens in the validator?

We've considered offering people the capacity to stake their unvested tokens. We will probably not allow all private sale tokens to be used in a node upon network launch so as to not crowd out validators who are buying from the public sale. We will answer more details on this later.

## What does the reward model of running a validator on TestNet look like?

If you're interested in attracting additional capital for your validator, please fill this Google Form out: [https://forms.gle/DT4bPfc3vUTYg4e79](https://forms.gle/DT4bPfc3vUTYg4e79). We'll share the results with people interested in delegating and match potentials. Our paid validator network ran for several weeks before we realized we weren't able to derive much value for it.

## Where can one take a look at the Sifchain UI?

The UI code is available [on Github](https://github.com/Sifchain/sifnode/tree/develop/ui).

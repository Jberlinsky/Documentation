# Technical Overview

Sifchain is built on top of the Cosmos-SDK.

The [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake \(PoS\) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub, as well as permissioned Proof-Of-Authority \(PoA\) blockchains. Blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK are generally referred to as **application-specific blockchains**.

Sifchain is the world's first omni-chain decentralized exchange. Built with the Cosmos SDK, Sifchain is 100x more efficient than current leading DeXes. Sifchain inherits the cross-chain capabilities of Thorchain and uses pegged tokens to support cross-chain transactions across a wide array of blockchains.

Sifchain is the world's first omni-chain decentralized exchange. Swap & pool the native ROWAN token with ETH and popular ERC-20 tokens on the Sifchain DEX, which is 100x more efficient than other leading DEXes.

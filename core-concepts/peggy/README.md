## About

Peggy is a CosmosSDK application for moving assets on and off of EVM based, POW chains.

Peggy is the starting point for cross chain value transfers from the Ethereum blockchain to Cosmos-SDK based blockchains as part of the Ethereum Cosmos Bridge project. The system accepts incoming transfers of Ethereum tokens on an Ethereum smart contract, locking them while the transaction is validated and equitable funds issued to the intended recipient on the Cosmos bridge chain. The system supports value transfers from Cosmos-SDK based blockchains to the Ethereum blockchain as well through a reverse process.

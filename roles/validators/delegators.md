# Delegators

Delegators are ROWAN holders who cannot, or do not want to run a validator themselves. ROWAN holders can delegate ROWAN tokens to a validator and obtain a part of their revenue in exchange .

Because they share revenue with their validators, delegators also share risks. Should a validator misbehave, each of their delegators will be partially slashed in proportion to their delegated stake. This is why delegators should perform due diligence on validators before delegating, as well as spreading their stake over multiple validators.

Delegators play a critical role in the system, as they are responsible for choosing validators. Being a delegator is not a passive role: Delegators should actively monitor the actions of their validators and participate in governance.

# Liquidity Providers

## Introduction

Liquidity providers provide assets to the Sifchain liquidity pools. They are compensated with swap fees and system rewards. Compensation is affected by a number of factors related to the pool and the state of the network.

Liquidity providers are able to deposit any token Sifchian supports to the appropriate pool. Anyone can create a liquidity pool by pooling Rowan and a new token into a pool initialization transaction. The price of the new token is set based on the amount of Rowan pooled. Sifchain enforces a minimum CLP size but multiple depositors can contribute to the creation of a single CLP.

If users are simply adding to an already existing liquidity pool, they may do so asymmetrically. This means users can add either Rowan or the token \(TKN\) the pool comprises of. This is as opposed to Uniswap where users must add equal values of the settlement token \(ETH/UNI\) and the other token \(TKN\).  Liquidity providers are able to add or remove liquidity whenever they choose. 

## Why provide liquidity to a pool?

Liquidity pools are important in[ **decentralized finance \(DeFi\)**](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-defi) ****— particularly decentralized exchanges \(DEX\). Because Sifchain is the world’s first omni-chain DEX, this technology is fundamental to our vision. 

Sifchain enables liquidity providers to add liquidity into pools where they can earn income without constraints endemic to other exchanges. Liquidity providers can deposit any token Sifchain supports to the appropriate pool. They can add liquidity asymmetrically, meaning they can add only Rowan or only TKN for any token.

Sifchain rewards users providing liquidity with various forms of income. To learn more about 

## Liquidity Mining Rewards

Sifchain will run a 12-week liquidity mining program for poolers, in order to incentivize early adopters. Rewards are subject to change based on evaluations of the network from the Sifchain core team, community feedback, and governance over time.

To learn more about this program and what you can expect to earn as part of this program, reference our announcement article [here, section 'Liquidity Mining for Poolers'.](https://medium.com/sifchain-finance/uses-for-rowan-the-polyvalent-token-for-omni-chain-decentralized-exchange-dex-3207e7f70f02)
